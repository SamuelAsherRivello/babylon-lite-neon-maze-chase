# AI Template Usage Checklist

Use this checklist only when creating a project from this repository. For
reference-only requests, follow `AGENTS.md` and do not copy files.

## 1. Confirm project and destination

- [ ] Keep every generated or copied project in strict TypeScript, including all source, tests, executable configuration and tooling. Carry this requirement into the new project's AGENTS.md so human and AI updates retain it.

- [ ] Identify the reuse mode: new GitHub repository, local project copy, or
      reference only. Do not mix repository-creation workflows.
- [ ] Confirm or discover the project's purpose, target platforms, selected
      stack, deployment target, dependency policy, and whether OpenSpec is
      required. Ask only for material facts that are neither provided nor
      discoverable from the project.
- [ ] Decide whether the resulting project is a **game** or an **app**. For a
      game, retain the Babylon content and Babylon dependencies as the starting
      point, adapting them to the requested game. For an app, remove Babylon
      content and Babylon dependencies, including associated imports, tests,
      assets, and documentation that exist only for that content. Update the
      lockfile after dependency changes.
- [ ] Choose **portrait** or **landscape** for the app or game concept before
      implementation, based on its intended use and content. Use the matching
      template viewport display, remove its orientation toggle, shortcut, and
      persisted override, and implement only the chosen orientation. Do not
      select square for a new app or game concept. Record the choice in project
      documentation or implementation notes.
- [ ] For a game, replace the Babylon showcase with the requested game; do not
      mistake it for gameplay. Babylon Lite is WebGPU-only: show a clear
      unsupported-browser message and do not add a fallback renderer. Implement
      the requested scene and renderer setup, including for 3D. Use Pixel
      Perfect for every 2D game, while choosing logical resolution and render
      scale for that game. For Babylon Lite 2D sprites, initialize
      BabylonLiteAIEntry in PixelPerfect2D mode and route sprite creation,
      position updates, and layer-view changes through its API. Keep fractional
      simulation state separate from snapped render positions. Never call
      addSprite2D/updateSprite2D or mutate layer.view directly in game code;
      document transforms that suspend pixel-perfect appearance.
- [ ] Keep primary game content in the viewport so it works in windowed and
      fullscreen modes. Keep the template gutter layout; secondary gutter
      content such as instructions, design elements, or backstory is optional.
      Choose whether and how game content scrolls to suit the game.
- [ ] Game audio is optional and music is not recommended. If sound is
      included, recommend 4 to 10 event-based sound effects and provide both a
      UI mute toggle and a documented URL argument that mutes all sound for AI
      testing.
- [ ] For GitHub creation, use GitHub's **Use this template** flow when the user
      has authorized creating the destination. For a local copy, require an
      explicitly named destination and copy tracked files without `.git`,
      history, branches, or tags. Do not create a destination on the user's
      behalf if it was not requested.
- [ ] If repository settings or access prevent the selected workflow, continue
      independent local work and record the external action as pending with the
      specific access needed.
- [ ] Decide whether optional AI skills belong in the resulting project. Skills
      are not bundled by default. Keep skills in global storage when they are
      part of an individual's workflow; add a project-local skill only when the
      project depends on that skill and collaborators or automation need the
      same capability. Before adding one, check its license, maintenance
      status, and whether it introduces generated files or additional setup.
- [ ] Consider these possible sources for optional skills:
      [ai-skills-library](https://github.com/SamuelAsherRivello/ai-skills-library/)
      for general-purpose skills,
      [ai-skills-tiled](https://github.com/SamuelAsherRivello/ai-skills-tiled/)
      for Tiled-focused skills, and
      [ai-skills-blender](https://github.com/SamuelAsherRivello/ai-skills-blender)
      for Blender-focused skills.
- [ ] Have humans choose and install only the relevant skill using their AI
      tool's normal skill-installation mechanism. AI agents must first follow
      the repository's `AGENTS.md`, then use an available global skill, and
      finally use a project-local skill when the repository explicitly includes
      or requires one. Do not assume that a link alone installs or activates a
      skill. For every included external skill, record its source, version or
      commit, license, and setup steps. Do not copy an entire skills repository
      when a single skill is sufficient.

## 2. Establish the new project

Apply these items only to a newly created GitHub repository or local project
copy:

- [ ] For a new repository, initialize fresh history with exactly one initial
      commit named `Initial Commit`. Before project-specific changes, verify
      `git rev-list --count HEAD` returns `1` and
      `git log -1 --format=%B` returns `Initial Commit`. If GitHub's template
      flow created a different bootstrap commit, normalize only that initial
      state before project work; do not rewrite history after project-specific
      commits exist.
- [ ] For GitHub creation, verify `origin` points to the new project repository
      before pushing. For a local-only copy, do not invent or configure a
      remote.
- [ ] Before project-specific implementation, rename the copied `project-name/`
      application directory to a concise, fitting name for the new app or game.
      Update Vite's `root`, both TypeScript config include lists, npm test paths,
      workflow paths, project documentation paths, generated-output
      exclusions in `.gitignore`, and every other reference to the old folder
      name. Keep the directory named `project-name/` in the template repository
      itself. Then replace `{project-name}`, `{github-owner}`, and
      `{repository-name}` with confirmed metadata.
- [ ] Rename the README H1 (`# {project-name}`) and replace introduction,
      getting-started, and project-details placeholders with concise, verified
      project information.
- [ ] In the README's **Original AI Prompt** section, replace
      `[{original-ai-prompt-url}]({original-ai-prompt-url})` with a Markdown
      link whose text and destination are the source URL for the earliest
      substantive user prompt that started the project, usually the prompt
      invoking a project-creation skill. Do not link a later refinement or an
      AI-generated summary. If the source URL cannot be recovered, report this
      item as unverified and retain the placeholder rather than inventing a URL.
- [ ] When the destination is on GitHub and settings are accessible, set its
      About description and topics from the implemented purpose, technologies,
      platforms, and features. Remove inherited topics that do not apply; do
      not advertise planned capabilities. If access is unavailable, report the
      update as pending.
- [ ] For GitHub repositories, set the About website URL to
      `https://www.samuelasherrivello.com/`. Keep the project's live demo URL
      in the README's Live Demo section.
- [ ] Remove or replace template images, demo links, commands, packages, and
      release instructions that do not apply to the resulting project.
- [ ] Configure CI or deployment only when required and after the target and
      commands are known. Document the real release process and version policy
      when the project has a release workflow; confirm a demo URL is live
      before presenting it as the project's demo.
- [ ] Keep baseline package configuration at the repository root and
      application source, tests, and assets under the renamed application
      directory unless the selected stack deliberately changes this layout.
- [ ] Preserve or deliberately adapt the four HTML corner roles in `AGENTS.md`.

## 3. Select tooling and verification

- [ ] Retain strict TypeScript for app, test, config and tool source. Run
      `npm run check:typescript-source` and `npm run typecheck` before tests/build;
      verify injected type errors and orphan TS fail checks.
- [ ] Use headless/no-window browser automation; minimize only when required by
      browser capabilities and do not take desktop focus.


Base commands on the resulting project's inspected configuration; examples in
the template are not evidence that a command exists in the new project.

- [ ] Add only the runtime, package manager, and dependencies required by the
      project. Use existing test/build tools; add a new check tool only to
      address a concrete gap.
- [ ] Document actual setup, run, test, build, and formatting commands in the
      README. Do not document a command unless it exists and its configuration
      has been inspected.
- [ ] Update `.gitignore` for generated outputs, local state, and secrets. Keep
      the `node_modules/` and `project-name/dist/` exclusions if Node/Vite
      remains.
- [ ] Add a safe `.env.example` only if configuration is required; include no
      real credentials.
- [ ] Add focused automated checks when appropriate to the chosen stack and
      project behavior. Avoid duplicating existing coverage or adding tooling
      just to satisfy this generic checklist.
- [ ] For user-visible work, verify the rendered result in its real runtime or
      browser when available. Capture only current, representative screenshots;
      keep canonical README imagery in the project's documentation directory
      and temporary test output ignored.
- [ ] Document manual verification when it is necessary and cannot be
      automated. If a required runtime or access is unavailable, report the
      check as blocked or unverified with the reason.

## 4. OpenSpec setup (when required)

Perform this section only when OpenSpec is selected for the resulting project.

- [ ] Generate repository-local `.agents/skills/openspec-*` files in the
      resulting project using OpenSpec `1.13.1`. This template preserves only
      `.agents/skills/.openspec-target`; never hand-edit generated skills.
- [ ] Verify `openspec --version` reports `1.13.1`. If missing or different,
      install `@fission-ai/openspec@1.13.1` using the
      [official installation guide](https://openspec.dev/docs/installation).
- [ ] Run `openspec doctor --json` from the repository root. Confirm
      `.agents/skills/.openspec-target` contains `codex`, every generated skill
      folder matches its `name:` frontmatter, and every
      `metadata.generatedBy` value is `1.13.1`.
- [ ] Reopen Codex at the resulting repository root and verify `$openspec-*`
      autocomplete includes `$openspec-apply-change` before relying on the
      repository-local workflow. If reopening or UI inspection is unavailable,
      report it as unverified.
- [ ] Replace neutral `openspec/config.yaml` context with verified project
      constraints before planning the first substantial change.
- [ ] Keep `changes/` for active work and `specs/` for accepted specifications.
      Sync accepted delta specifications before archiving a completed change.

## 5. Delivery gate and summary

- [ ] Search for `project-name`, including paths in configuration and ignore
      files, and confirm no reference remains for the old application folder
      name in the resulting project. Then search for `{github-owner}`,
      `{repository-name}`,
      `{command}`, `{live-demo-url}`, `{demo_url}`,
      `github-repository-template`, `GitHub Repository Template`, and other
      template placeholders. Resolve or deliberately retain each occurrence
      with a documented reason.
- [ ] Run each applicable, documented local setup, test, build, and formatting
      command. Run deployment or release verification only when configured and
      authorized. Record the exact commands and outcomes.
- [ ] Verify README links, screenshots, commands, packages, deployment
      instructions, and release instructions against the resulting project.
- [ ] Verify the README's Original AI Prompt link points to the earliest
      substantive initiating prompt, or report it as unverified if its source
      URL is unavailable.
- [ ] For GitHub destinations, verify About metadata and website URL when
      access is available; otherwise mark the external update pending.
- [ ] Report each checklist item using one of these outcomes: **verified**,
      **not applicable** (with reason), **pending authorization** (with action
      needed), **blocked** (with cause), or **unverified** (with missing
      evidence).
- [ ] Call the project ready only when all applicable local checks pass and
      every remaining external or unverified item is clearly disclosed. Do not
      imply that a blocked or pending action was completed.

## 6. Template-use scorecard

Answer each question **true** or **false** based on evidence in the resulting
project. Award **+1 point for each true answer** (maximum 12 points).

- [ ] Is the project purpose reflected in a renamed app folder instead of
      leaving `project-name/` as the final application name?
- [ ] Does the Vite configuration point to the resulting app folder?
- [ ] Have the project-name, owner, and repository placeholders been replaced
      with confirmed values wherever applicable?
- [ ] Does the README describe the actual project rather than the generic
      template?
- [ ] Are setup, run, test, and build instructions based on commands that
      exist in the resulting project?
- [ ] Have template demo links, images, packages, and release instructions
      been removed or adapted to the resulting project?
- [ ] Does the app preserve or deliberately adapt the four HTML corner roles
      documented in `AGENTS.md`?
- [ ] Does the project document and implement exactly one selected orientation
      (portrait or landscape), with the orientation toggle removed?
- [ ] If the game includes sound, does it provide a UI mute toggle and a URL
      argument that mutes all sound?
- [ ] Are React UI shortcuts kept clear of WASD, the arrow keys, Spacebar, and
      Enter, with assigned keys shown in the UI?
- [ ] Does `.gitignore` cover the resulting project's generated files and
      local state while retaining relevant template exclusions?
- [ ] Are applicable checks and user-visible behavior verified, with any
      blocked or unverified items clearly reported?
